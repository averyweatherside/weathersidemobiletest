atlanta offices<br>
as i grow homesick and tired out west, my mind is filled with memories of my home in the south. but particularly recently, ive been thinking about atlanta, specifically the city in winter. my daddy worked in the city when i was younger, and i have such a sharp emotional image of what their office was like. i probably only went a handful of times, but it always felt so special. the whole building was almost completely concrete and brick, leaving the floors frigid and the air dank. the office all looked like the ideal 2000’s office space. the highlight of my visits would be a getting a diet coke in a can from the vending machine. it had one of those beautiful panels on the front, with the bright, saturated colors. i was allowed to drink it with red drink mixers too! i dont have a lot of happy childhood memories due to being trans and hating who i was as a kid, but this one is still something i can reminisce about. i love a carpet on concrete. laying on it and feeling the cold emanate faintly through the soft pills of carpet. i suddenly feel disgusted having written a useless paragraph of nostalgia. my apologies.
i ran a 5k through atlanta as well. well i walked a lot of it, i was a kid. but both of my parents were super into fitness and i already felt fat so i was doing a lot of working out stuff. i love the painful feeling of breathing in winter city air after running. it feels like your throat has gone grey and pink like cooked flesh and its so empty tight and painful. running as hard as you can but your so weak, every muscle hurts and this isnt even hard for most people. the only color you see in the grey, wet cityspace is those blue edward skelextry rain jackets. the buildings really look so pretty in this weather, it makes every piece of dekay and grime on the moulded concrete was purposeful to create this ambiance of a city out of its prime. i absolutely adore it. especially on the marta buildings. seriously sexy architecture and city scapes. but yeah that horrible pain of running in that cold, i love it so much. I dont know what that says about me.

sin
i feel a constant presence of sin on me. no matter what i do, how much i work out, how good i eat, how wholesomely i lead my life, how pretty i look, i have this feeling on my ribs. it pulls them down, down to hell moment by moment. a black tar, hands grabbing at my bones, tearing at my eyes, letting me know my life is not a holy one. i chose a path of sin and pain, and i realise that this is my true path. there was not an alternative. i was born cursed, pained by nothing but this sin in me, and let it tear me apart. i had to live though, this is the only way. 
i assume this feeling comes from being transgender, catholic, and raised by a mom with an eating disorder. im okay with all of that, and i still love all of these parts of my life. this is just how it leaves me. and i also think it comes from how alone i can be, romantically and otherwise. my life still feels like something disgusting and vile, and something to be ashamed of. 
i like the anime “the summer hikaru died”. i feel very similarly to hikaru. i actually had some early concept sketches and writings about a very similar premise before i saw someone had already done it. mine was more of a trans allegory though, so different there i guess. i was actually relived that i could see an idea i had be made into something by someone else, made me feel less alone. 
all of this sin leaves me with a strong urge to hurt myself. i really try hard to resist it, but i still do it lightly through sneaky ways. even right now, i refuse to admit it to myself, but i am currently not eating because i want to feel the pain of hunger. I know this is going to send me into an episode, but my desire to hurt clouds my judgement. disconsociating, enjoying the sensation. ive been like this for a long time, but only really realised it recently. it feels like my hands are whispering little prayers to me to shove them in a bed of coals. ssssssh! stop asking! i dont tend to actually hurt myself in a way that will mark though. my self preservation and desire for beauty is still strong enough to keep me in one piece.
 i feel like my life is a constant duel between desire to hurt and desire to live. 
i dont really know how to help with these feelings, i just let it get bad enough until i finally convince myself to smoke and that usually makes me eat. currently though, i feel eating would only make me more of a sinful girl.

art
i just listened to a lecture at yale by noah dillon. it got me excited about making so many genres of art. honestly, im suprised more musicians dont ever seem to be in a traditional art backround. he kinda is though, as a photographer. has galleries and shit. makes me feel more and more multimedia i want this current project to be. i still dont know what this “weatherside” project exactly is, but id just think of it as an introduction. i just left my old life behind to be a new woman at a real ass art school, and through truly transitioning fully now i have begun to form myself, for who i want to be. this project is the art side of that personal growth. the stuff im making now is truly the way i want to be perceived, at least for now. i am still so unaccustomed to not having so much to hide, and truly living as i please. its been the most enjoyable part of my life, this process of self discovery. nothing is like the security and value that comes from being genuine, and knowing you are you because you made yourself the real you. 
i also watched mulholland drive for the first time today. really enjoyed it. ive watched (in order) twin peaks, blue velvet, fire walk with me, and now mulholland drive over the past half of the year. he is definitely my favorite director. when i first bought the blue velvet cd, the woman at the register seemed completly disttacted, and excused herself after a few seconds because david lynch had just died, and he was her favriote director. i wish he was still alive so i could dream about talking to him.
