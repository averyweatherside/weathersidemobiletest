<br>I feel that i can be difficult to exactly resonate with something. i have a certain combination of identity, history, emotionality, and confusion that makes me not exactly able to feel fully one with a project. i live my life on the outskirts of community, never allowing myself to fully accommodate to a space as i always feel distant. different. and this is obviously not solely negative, especially in my field uniqueness is an incredible strength. but it does make it so much more important to me when i can see myself in something. 
when i first heart october country, i understood it was what my heart sounded like. ghost mountain’s use of compressed and distorted sounds is a genius continuation of the haunted mounds' past sounds. the ambiance created by this tonality, paired with ghost mountains near monotony delivered lines of heartbreak, anger, and mounded emotion makes a more subdued and self conscious side of sematary’s frustration and anger. </p1>

<br>a good friend of mine, cries, joked to me that “when you liked this album you became cool”. i think i agree. its definitely one of my most out there picks. its a really encapsulating album of our modern times, of the twentyfirst century. its been interesting to see the underground shift more into this visual style and attitude created by skeletrix. in january when this dropped, the use of ai to create purposely uncanny imagery,  was only really him, but recently ive seen that style embraced more, like by lucy bedroque. though i cant say i agree with the ethics of it, its the only interesting use of ai that leans into the disgusting element of it. 
the album sounds like the year 2025. overwhelming, toxic, bright, empty, and sick. skeletrix presents himself as disgusted by this world, but also a part of it. i actually wrote an argument piece for a magazine on this record. i argued it was a stellar record, one strengthened by its weaknesses. i will attempt to find this and put it on the website, but i dont believe that article ever got officially published. tragic!

<h3> III CRYSTAL CASTLES </h3>

plague is one of those songs that make a good record a great one. the absolute strength and direction this opening track provided fuels the soundscape that is III. focus and precision onto a sound mixed with a commitment to the art creates for a mental space to be created by the audio experence. this creation of a space can be influenced by other elements like space and mental altering substances. the first time i listened to this album, i was high in my basement with my friends visiting from college. i had bought the record on vinyl off of their recommendation, and after we had smoked a vicious joint in the woods down in the ravine, we returned to the dark, clean basement and i set the needle on the record. the space of hanging out with some cool ass californians, very older brother-y, and listing to their music while fried off real flower was already a good choice for this record, and the beauty of plague let me instantly know that this would be a special album.
